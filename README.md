HedronDB is a local-first knowledge store for software agents. It records **what should be true** (desired state) and **what happened** (an append-only causal log), then lets you query both without a hosted control plane.

One binary, `hedron`. One file, SQLite. Mutations go through an in-process store with vault isolation and short-lived tokens. Reads can go through **HQL**, a small pipe language that never writes.

It is for people who want intent and reconciliation next to the agent, not in a remote database. [Facet](https://github.com/VirtualMachinist/facet) is the API client and run history. HedronDB is the intent store. They work together; they do not share a database.

**0.1.0** · `hedron` CLI · HQL v0 · rusqlite

## Quick start

**1. Build.**

```bash
cargo build --release --bins
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

**2. Import a markdown tree.**

```bash
hedron import --src ./notes --db ./intent.db --vault my-vault --agent my-agent
```

**3. Query it.**

```bash
hedron hql --db ./intent.db --format json 'vault my-vault | search "HedronDB" | limit 20'
```

`hedron hql` opens the file read-only. Quote the pipeline so the shell is not the parser.

## What it is

| | HedronDB |
|---|---|
| Store | One SQLite file (`nodes`, `edges`, `desired_states`, `events`) |
| Isolation | Named vaults |
| Writes | `Store` API with in-process tokens (never printed, never in YAML) |
| Reads | `hedron hql` — read-only pipes |
| Twin | `python/hql` must return the same JSON for the same pipeline |

**Warm vs cool.** `state` is the latest desired-state spec/status (what is true now). `history` is the causal chain of that state (what superseded what). They are separate APIs and must not be mixed.

## What you get

- **`hedron import`** — walk a markdown tree into the store (wikilinks become `mentions`; unresolved targets are allowed).
- **`hedron hql`** — operators `vault`, `agent`, `state`, `history`, `search`, `traverse`, `filter`, `select`, `limit`. Unknown operators (including `causal`) are rejected.
- **`hedron-import`** — thin alias of `hedron import`. Prefer `hedron import`.
- **Rust/Python result twin** — `cargo test --test hql_twin` compares `hedron hql --format json` with `python3 -m hql`.

## HQL, for humans and agents

HQL is a small pipe language, not SQL. One string, two audiences:

| | Human | Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Command | `hedron hql --db FILE 'vault x \| state'` | the same, plus `--format json` |
| Output | table or TSV in a terminal | deterministic JSON |
| Writes | none — HQL never mutates | none — HQL never mutates |
| Proof | you can read the table | Rust CLI and `python/hql` must agree on the JSON |

A person explores: search a vault, follow mentions, look at **what is true now** (`state`) or **how it got that way** (`history`). An agent does the same pipeline as a tool call and parses JSON. If the two ever disagree, that is a bug (`cargo test --test hql_twin`).

Mutations are a different door: the `Store` API (tokens, reconcile). HQL cannot be used to “just update the row.” That split is the product: agents can look freely and cannot accidentally rewrite intent through a query.

Operators: `vault`, `agent`, `state`, `history`, `search`, `traverse`, `filter`, `select`, `limit`. Unknown names are rejected. Details: [docs/HQL.md](docs/HQL.md).

## HedronDB and Facet

Facet and HedronDB answer different questions. Facet: what did we call, and what came back? (YAML collections + Lattice runs.) HedronDB: what did we mean to be true, and how did that change? (desired state + causal log.) They meet in a session via IDs (actor, run, vault, event), not a shared table.

| | [Facet](https://github.com/VirtualMachinist/facet) | HedronDB |
|---|---|---|
| Question | What did we call, and what came back? | What did we mean to be true, and how did that change? |
| Canonical files | OpenCollection YAML (Git) | One SQLite intent file |
| History | **Lattice** — runs, bodies, sessions | **Causal log** — desired vs observed, supersession |
| Query | `facet history` (SQL over runs) | `hedron hql` pipes |
| Binary | `facet` | `hedron` |

Neither product embeds the other. Wire them with a small CLI or MCP tool, scoped to a file and vault.

## A real run

You want two replicas of `web` Ready. Facet does the HTTP. HedronDB holds the intent. HQL is how you (or an agent) look.

**1. Call the cluster — Facet records what came back.**

```bash
facet request run ./api/workloads/scale-web.yml --environment prod --json
# Lattice now has the run: status, URL, body hash, session id
facet history --sql "SELECT status, url FROM runs ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1"
```

**2. Ask HedronDB what we meant — same pipe for a human and an agent.**

Human (table):

```bash
hedron hql --db ./intent.db \
  'vault prod | agent deploy | state | select path, extra.title, state_version, status'
```

```text
path          extra.title  state_version  status
agents/deploy deploy       2              Reconciled
```

Agent (JSON — identical rows):

```bash
hedron hql --db ./intent.db --format json \
  'vault prod | agent deploy | state | select path, extra.title, state_version, status'
```

```json
[
  {
    "path": "agents/deploy",
    "extra.title": "deploy",
    "state_version": 2,
    "status": "Reconciled"
  }
]
```

`state` is **now** (latest desired vs observed). Version 2 is Reconciled: the cluster matches the spec. An agent parses the JSON; a person reads the table. HQL did not write anything.

**3. If it wasn’t Reconciled — look at how we got here.**

```bash
hedron hql --db ./intent.db --format json \
  'vault prod | agent deploy | history | select id, ts, reconciles, supersedes'
```

`history` is **how it changed** (causal chain only — no spec payload). Facet’s Lattice still has the HTTP evidence for the same session; HedronDB still has the intent. You join them by IDs, not by dumping both into one database.

## How it works

One file, two query paths, no network.

- Store files should be mode `0600`.
- Tokens live in process memory and rotate at the library gate. `hedron hql` does not take a token.
- The crate is synchronous. No tokio, HTTP, or extra TCP ports.
- Schema drift is reported, not migrated.

## Status

Phase 0 is the working tree at **0.1.0**; track `main`.

- **Store / vaults / desired state / causal log:** ready.
- **HQL v0 + Python twin:** ready.
- **Import:** ready.
- **Not in this repo:** HTTP service, SQL as the query language, embeddings, a UI, or a cluster control plane.

CI (`ubuntu-latest`, rustc 1.83) runs `cargo test` and a release build of `hedron`.
